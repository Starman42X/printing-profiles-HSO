# Printing profiles HSO
A repository for different printing profiles

### Pretested on every machine prior upload

## Balanced
In **Balanced** mode, the printer optimizes print time, quality and detail. Useful for generic prints.

## Draft
In **Draft** mode, the printer aims for the highest print speed possible with thick layers. Use this mode only if you need your part asap and do not care about quality.

## Detail
In **Detail** mode, the printer prioritizes beautiful prints over stability and print time. Use this mode only for figurines or similar as it will not be able to withstand any stress in forms of heat, impact resistance and rigidity.

## Engineering
In **Engineering** mode, the printer delivers the best tolerances, highest accuracy & superior impact resistance at the expense of significantly more print time. It is intended for printing functional prototypes and end to use parts for harsh environments.
